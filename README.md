# no-mode-ui

> Built on [Shapeshift](https://github.com/anishfn/shapeshift) by Anish (MIT, upstream commit `71a6839`). This repo extends it with new "never pick a mode" use cases, see [docs/BRIEF.md](docs/BRIEF.md). Shapeshift's original README follows.

# Shapeshift

**An input that becomes what you mean.** One text box that morphs into the right UI as you type — an event card, a checklist, a timer, a color picker, a bill splitter, a poll, a converter and more.

```
dinner with priya friday 8pm on zoom   →  Event card · Friday · 8 PM · Priya · Video call
buy milk, eggs, bread and coffee       →  Shopping checklist
split 2400 between 3                   →  ₹800 each
minecraft diamond                      →  #4AEDD9
```

Intent is classified by [TypeSafe AI](https://typesafe.ai)'s **Jev** model: one call answers 14 typed questions in parallel (which card, plus signals like "is it a video call?", "is it urgent?"). Everything else — dates, amounts, units, math — is deterministic code. **Jev decides, code computes.**

<p align="center"><img src="docs/diagrams/jev-fanout.svg" alt="One Jev call answers 14 questions in parallel; a deterministic parser reads the same text for values" width="820"></p>

It works **fully offline by default** with a built-in keyword classifier, so you can run it without an account.

## Quick start

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.2+.

```bash
bun install
bun dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 and start typing. Press <kbd>/</kbd> to see every card type.

### Use the online Jev model (optional)

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# then set TYPESAFE_API_KEY=... (get one at https://console.typesafe.ai/keys)
```

Restart `bun dev`. The latency readout in the bottom-right corner switches from `jev-offline` to `jev-1.13.0`. The key is only ever read on the server (`/api/intent`); it never reaches the browser. If the API is unreachable or rate-limited, Shapeshift quietly falls back to offline mode.

| Variable | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` | _(empty)_ | Enables the online model. Empty or placeholder values keep you offline. |
| `JEV_MODEL` | `jev-1.13.0` | Pinned model version. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK` | `false` | `true` forces offline even with a key. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | `http://localhost:3000` | Used for Open Graph metadata. |

## Card types

| Card | Try |
| --- | --- |
| Event | `lunch with rahul and anna tomorrow` |
| Reminder | `remind me to pay rent tomorrow urgent` |
| Checklist | `buy milk, eggs, bread and coffee` |
| Timer | `25 min focus` |
| Habit | `gym 3x a week` |
| Color | `#ff6b35`, `tiffany blue`, `minecraft diamond` |
| Split | `split 2400 between 3` |
| Expense | `spent 450 on uber` |
| Convert | `5 miles in km`, `72f to c` |
| Calculate | `18% of 3450` |
| Trip | `flight to goa next weekend` |
| Poll | `pizza or burgers for friday?` |
| Contact | `rahul 98200 12345 rahul@mail.com` |
| Bookmark | `https://vercel.com/blog check later` |
| Countdown | `days until christmas` |
| Time zone | `3pm pst in ist`, `what time is it in tokyo` |
| Random | `roll 2d6`, `flip a coin`, `pick one: tacos, sushi or pizza` |
| Goal | `read 12 books this year, 4 done` |
| Note | anything else |

Saved cards live in your browser (`localStorage`) until you delete them. Click one to edit it.

### Keyboard

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Save the card |
| <kbd>Esc</kbd> | Clear (or cancel an edit) |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd> | Keep a faint preview |
| <kbd>←</kbd> <kbd>→</kbd> | Choose between "Did you mean" chips |
| <kbd>/</kbd> | Open every card type |

URL flags: `?debug=1` shows every probability; `?demo=1&loop=1` plays a scripted demo.

## How it works

<p align="center"><img src="docs/diagrams/architecture.svg" alt="Keystroke, debounced hook, server route, Jev or offline classifier, decide, gate signals, parse, card" width="820"></p>

Raw model output flickers as you type, so a small state machine turns confidence into calm UI states. A card only changes when a challenger wins twice in a row (or is very sure), and signal badges use an on/off hysteresis band.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/diagrams/states.svg" alt="States: input, ghost preview, choose between two chips, committed card, with the thresholds between them" width="820"></p>

The diagrams are Excalidraw files — open any `docs/diagrams/*.excalidraw` at [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com) to edit them.

| Path | What lives there |
| --- | --- |
| `src/components/intents/registry.ts` | **The extension point.** One entry per card type. |
| `src/lib/jev/questions.ts` | The Jev question schema |
| `src/lib/jev/mock.ts` | Offline keyword classifier (same output shape) |
| `src/lib/parse/` | One deterministic parser per card type |
| `src/lib/decide.ts`, `src/lib/signals.ts` | The calm-UI state machine |
| `src/components/shapeshift/` | Shell, chips, palette, saved list, HUD |

### Adding a card type

1. Add the key to `INTENT_KEYS` in `src/lib/jev/types.ts`.
2. Add a non-overlapping criterion to `intent` in `src/lib/jev/questions.ts`.
3. Write a parser in `src/lib/parse/` and register it in `src/lib/parse/index.ts`.
4. Write a card component in `src/components/intents/` and add a registry entry.
5. Teach the offline classifier in `src/lib/jev/mock.ts`, and add tests.

TypeScript will point at anything you missed.

## Development

```bash
bun run check    # typecheck + lint + tests
bun test         # parser, decision, signal and classifier tests
bun run build
